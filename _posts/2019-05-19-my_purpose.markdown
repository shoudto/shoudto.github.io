Hi, my name is Oscar Shoudt and I am a college student pursuing a computer science degree and my story is that I always wanted to learn coding but didn't know how I been in my college for 3 years and I still havent learned a line of code. I joined flatiron to change that around because I am really dedicated in becoming a software developer. It's been my dream to be able to build website and apps for companies because I found that interesting and for sure my passion.
