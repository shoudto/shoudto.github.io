I learned a lot from flatiron academy the fact that you can use class methods within other classes really helped made the program execution very smooth. It was easy to grasp the concept when I was working on my CLI project in order to scrape in one class but still be able to call the method in another class. Where they both can function together in order to scrape tthe info froma website and create a program with ruby in order to print a list of items or objects.
