What is the best part of being assigned your first CLI Project? Perhaps the
ability to put your growing skills and originality to the test. Here I am, facing
the opportunity of trial and error. You must find an idea you enjoy
brainstorming with and then you begin the works. You mess up once or twice
along the way, realize your distress is not allowing you to understand what
you are doing to try to get it to work, come back to your senses, and boom!

I find before myself… the result of my first successful Command Line
Interface! I dedicate this to all my fellow beer lovers. This is how it
functions: you get an extensive numbered list of craft beers. By typing in the
number of the beer and hitting ‘ENTER’, the screen will display the name of
the beer, the company, its origin, and the alcohol percentage.

The number of hours spent creating this Command Line Interface Gem with
not much knowledge is just a glimpse of my interest in coding. The thing
about challenges is, not only does it enforce you to learn it, but it motivates
you to not give up. It gives you a sense of willingness. It allows you to grasp
the information for the long term.

I am thrilled to discover what more I am capable of as I continue my
development with Flatiron.
