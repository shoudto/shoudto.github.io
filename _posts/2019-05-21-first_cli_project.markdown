Finished my first project on May 19, 2019 for Flatiron and may I say what a journey it was I honestly never built a project in my life and the fact that I started with no knowledge of how to code. I was able to create a cli project on which it was about craft beers. Where you get a list of craft beers and you choose the one you want and it will give information about the beer. I found this cool because I always wanted to be able to build something like this on my own and it was definitely a challenge the amount of hours I had to dedicate in order to achieve my goal for this project. 

I will say is I learned way more in Flatiron within 3 weeks then I will ever learn in the 3 years I been in college and this is a step and push I need to reach my goal on becoming a web developer and eventually my ultimate goal on becoming a freelancer and able to create projects I choose fit. I really want to get skilled at building websites and apps that are very mobile friendly because I know that's what satisfies me and for sure other people in the world. One day I want people to enjoy and use the apps and websites that I created. So far I am enjoying the challenge and can't wait what more I am able to do!
